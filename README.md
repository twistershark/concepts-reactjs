# ReactJS Concepts

Simple React project to practice the concepts of ReactJS. The idea of this project is to access the backend developed in another challenge and to be able to create, list and delete repositories.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node: version 12 or higher
Yarn: version 1

### Installing

After you clone this repository, enter the repository folder and run on the terminal:
```
yarn
```

After that, you may be able to start the app using:

```
yarn start
```

## Running the tests

If you want to test any implementation, you should be able to run:

```
yarn test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The tests are going to verify if it's possible to create, update, list and delete the repositories and if it's possible to give a like to a certain repository.
